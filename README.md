An efficient Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system combining YOLOv8 for detection, SORT for tracking, and PaddleOCR for text recognition. Designed for real-world deployment with optimized performance.

## Features

- 🚗 **Direct license plate detection** using custom-trained YOLOv8n model
- 🔍 **High-accuracy OCR** with PaddleOCR (superior to EasyOCR for angled/blurry plates)
- 🏷️ **Frame-to-frame tracking** using SORT algorithm
- ⚡ **Optimized performance** for edge devices and Google Colab
- 📹 **Video processing** with frame-by-frame analysis
- 📊 **Comprehensive outputs** including annotated videos and plate data

## Performance

| Metric            | Value   |
|-------------------|---------|
| mAP50             | 98.6%   |
| mAP50-95          | 70%     |
| OCR Confidence    | ≥0.7    |
| FPS (1080p)       | ~25-30  |
